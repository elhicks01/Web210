          <h3>Blossom Beauty Co.</h3>
          <p>For my final project in WEB110, I crafted a captivating makeup enthusiast event called "Unleash Your Inner Beauty - A Makeup Masterclass." Hosted by the fictitious company, Blossom Beauty Co., the event catered to makeup lovers of all skill levels, fostering an inclusive and engaging experience.

            The centerpiece of the event was a mesmerizing makeup masterclass, led by renowned makeup artist, Ava Martinez. Through a responsive and aesthetically pleasing website, attendees could effortlessly register using the embedded sign-up form. The site also featured an interactive map, ensuring smooth navigation to the event venue.
            
            As a web designer, I focused on creating a seamless user experience, aligning aesthetics with functionality. The website's layout showcased the vibrant world of makeup, while intuitive design elements facilitated user engagement and event registration.
